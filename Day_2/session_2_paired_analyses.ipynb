    "This section will focus on methods for pairwise spatial analysis - comparing whether two populations are spatially correlated. There are a large number of spatial metrics which deal with this topic, many of which we have tutorials for (https://docs.muspan.co.uk/latest/tutorials.html). Here, we'll focus on the cross-pair correlation function (xPCF) and Moran's I / Getis-Ord.\n",

    "- Use the topographical correlation map to visualise hotspots of correlation within a domain\n",
    "- Explore the effect of changing the domain boundary on the cross-PCF, and understand the importance of accurate domain boundaries\n",

This annulus has width `annulus_width`, and the function that we consider here if calculated at specific values of $r$ (one every `annulus_step` - so here at 0, 10, 20, ..., 100).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. A key part of the cross-PCF analysis, and indeed any spatial analysis, is the shape of the domain (i.e., the boundary). Load in any example domain, and calculate the cross-PCF between two cell types. Now [try manually changing the domain boundary](https://docs.muspan.co.uk/latest/muspan.domain.html#muspan.domain.estimate_boundary) to make it much bigger (for instance, twice as big in both the $x$ and $y$ directions). What happens when you recalculate the same cross-PCF on the same cell types? Can you explain why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The boundary of a cross-PCF is extremely important, as we've just seen. Try [following the tutorial on using shapes as calculation boundaries for cross-PCFs](https://docs.muspan.co.uk/latest/_collections/spatial_analysis_methods/Spatial%20stats%20-%202%20-%20boundary%20corrections.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Load in the dataset `Synthetic-Points-Exclusion` and calculate the cross-PCF betwen cell types A and B. You should see strong spatial correlation, as the points are all in the same part of the domain. Try [following the instructions in the tutorial on converting points to shapes](https://docs.muspan.co.uk/latest/_collections/working_with_objects/WWO%20-%203%20-%20points%20to%20shape%203.html) to make the convex hull around all points of type D. Can you use this shape as the boundary for the cross-PCF analysis (between cell types A and B)? What do you see?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There are many other approaches for comparing pairs of point populations, many of which can be found in [the documentation for MuSpAn's spatial statistics](https://docs.muspan.co.uk/latest/muspan.spatial_statistics.html). Try out some others - you may want to consider the K-function, the J-function, and the average nearest neighbour index (for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The TCM provides one way of showing local correlation between cells of different types, but there are many other methods. Try following the tutorial on Getis-Ord hotspot analysis to identify whether there is a correlation between cells of types D and A in the `Synthetic-Points-Architecture` dataset."
